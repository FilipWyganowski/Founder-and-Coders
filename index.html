        <h2>Founders<span class="color"> and </span> Coders<br>Application</h2>
        <p>I am a documentary maker and have been fortunate enough to work in some amazing places with extra ordinary people from around the world.  One of my stand out moments would be meeting and filming a day in a life of a cook in a South Korean shipyard.  She was no ordinary chef but a master of keeping the thousands of workers that would attend her canteen feed and happy.  At the bottom you will find a clip of her in action<br><br>

I am quite proud of this clip as it puts together quite a lot of different technical abilities I picked up over the years.  I enjoy teaching these skills to other crew members.  It is very satisfying to see a colleague put into action the techniques I passed on.  I have also run a filmmaking group that teaches and provides equipment for children and adults to make short films and documentaries.  I strongly feel that filmmaking is a great way to express oneself.  Technology has a huge potential to open up the world of filmmaking for people who might otherwise struggle as a result of their situation or disabilities to have the ability to shoot.</p>
